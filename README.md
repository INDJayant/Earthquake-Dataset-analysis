🌍📊 Earthquake Dashboard Project — Visualizing 14,692 Seismic Events Using Power BI 💥📈

I’m excited to share my recent Data Visualization project built using Power BI, where I analyzed a global dataset of earthquakes that occurred between November 2008 to January 2023 — over 14,000 events in total!

🔍 This interactive dashboard dives deep into seismic activity trends across different dimensions like magnitude, depth, location, time (year/month), and more. Here's a breakdown of what I explored and discovered:

📌 Key Dashboard Insights:

✅ Total Earthquakes by Magnitude
The majority of recorded earthquakes fell within the 4.5 – 4.9 magnitude range, emphasizing frequent moderate tremors.

✅ Geographic Analysis
Using Bing Maps, I plotted global earthquake locations. Most notable clusters appeared in and around the Indo-Australian region, providing a clear visualization of seismic hotspots.

✅ Depth Histogram
Over 10,000 earthquakes occurred at shallow depths (0–100 km), which typically pose greater surface-level risks.

✅ Monthly Patterns
A fascinating trend was how earthquake occurrences varied across months — with March, August, and December showing comparatively higher numbers.

✅ Yearly Trends
From 2010 to 2022, there was a visible rise in frequency, peaking between 2017–2020, before tapering off.

✅ Magnitude vs. Depth Scatter Plot
While one might assume deeper quakes are stronger, the plot helped visualize that no consistent linear correlation exists between magnitude and depth.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used:

Power BI: For visuals, filters, slicers, tooltips, drill-downs, and DAX measures

Excel/CSV: For initial data preprocessing

Map Visualizations: For geospatial analysis

Histograms & Line Graphs: For temporal and categorical insights

🎯 Takeaways:
This project gave me a hands-on experience with:

Real-world datasets

Temporal and geospatial data analytics

Interactive dashboard design

Storytelling through data

It also reinforced how data science can help inform disaster preparedness by extracting insights from historic events.

💬 I'd love to connect with others working on geospatial analytics, Power BI dashboards, or disaster data modeling. Let’s share insights and collaborate!
